# ABSTRACT 

Optimization is ubiquitous. While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to our main application in prompt optimization, where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

Large Language Models as Optimizers 

# 1 INTRODUCTION 

Optimization is critical for all areas. Many optimization techniques are iterative: the optimization starts from an initial solution, then iteratively updates the solution to optimize the objective function (Amari, 1993; Qian, 1999; Kingma & Ba, 2015; Bäck & Schwefel, 1993; Rios & Sahinidis, 2013; Reeves, 1993). The optimization algorithm typically needs to be customized for an individual task to deal with the specific challenges posed by the decision space and the performance landscape, especially for derivative-free optimization. 

In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to utilize large language models (LLMs) as optimizers. With the advancement of prompting techniques, LLMs have achieved impressive performance in various domains (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022a; Madaan et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023e). Their ability to understand natural language lays out a new possibility for optimization: instead of formally defining the optimization problem and deriving the update step with a programmed solver, we describe the optimization problem in natural language, then instruct the LLM to iteratively generate new solutions based on the problem description and the previously found solutions. Optimization with LLMs enables quick adaptation to different tasks by changing the problem description in the prompt, and the optimization process can be customized by adding instructions to specify the desired properties of the solutions. 

To demonstrate the potential of LLMs for optimization, we first present case studies on linear regression and the traveling salesman problem, which are two classic optimization problems that underpin many others in mathematical optimization, computer science, and operations research. On small-scale optimization problems, we show that LLMs are able to find good-quality solutions simply through prompting, and sometimes match or surpass hand-designed heuristic algorithms. 

Next, we demonstrate the ability of LLMs to optimize prompts: the goal is to find a prompt that maximizes the task accuracy. Specifically, we focus on natural language tasks where both the task input and output are texts. LLMs are shown to be sensitive to the prompt format (Zhao et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2023; Madaan & Yazdanbakhsh, 2022); in particular, semantically similar prompts may have drastically different performance (Kojima et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022b; Zhang et al., 2023), and the optimal prompt formats can be model-specific and task-specific (Ma et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023c). Therefore, prompt engineering is often important for LLMs to achieve good performance (Reynolds & McDonell, 2021). However, the large and discrete prompt space makes it challenging for optimization, especially when only API access to the LLM is available. Following prior work on continuous and discrete prompt optimization (Lester et al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021; Zhou et al., 2022b; Pryzant et al., 2023), we assume a training set is available to compute the training accuracy as the objective value for optimization, and we show in experiments that optimizing the prompt for accuracy on a small training set is sufficient to reach high performance on the test set. 

The prompt to the LLM serves as a call to the optimizer, and we name it the _meta-prompt_ . Figure 3 shows an example. The meta-prompt contains two core pieces of information. The first piece is previously generated prompts with their corresponding training accuracies. The second piece is the optimization problem description, which includes several exemplars randomly selected from the training set to exemplify the task of interest. We also provide instructions for the LLM to understand the relationships among different parts and the desired output format. Different from recent work on using LLMs for automatic prompt generation (Zhou et al., 2022b; Pryzant et al., 2023), each optimization step in our work _generates_ new prompts that aim to increase the test accuracy based on a trajectory of previously generated prompts, instead of _editing_ one input prompt according to natural language feedback (Pryzant et al., 2023) or requiring the new prompt to follow the same semantic meaning (Zhou et al., 2022b). Making use of the full optimization trajectory, OPRO enables the LLM to gradually generate new prompts that improve the task accuracy throughout the optimization process, where the initial prompts have low task accuracies. 

We conduct comprehensive evaluation on several LLMs, including text-bison and Palm 2-L in the PaLM-2 model family (Anil et al., 2023), as well as gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 in the GPT model family. We optimize prompts on GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and Big-Bench Hard (Suzgun et al., 2022), which are reasoning benchmarks where prompting techniques have achieved remarkable performance breakthrough (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022; Suzgun et al., 2022). Starting from initial prompts with low task accuracies, we show that all LLMs in our evaluation are able to

Figure 2: An overview of the OPRO framework. Given the meta-prompt as the input, the LLM generates new solutions to the objective function, then the new solutions and their scores are added into the meta-prompt for the next optimization step. The meta-prompt contains the solution-score pairs obtained throughout optimization, a natural language description of the task, and (in prompt optimization) a few task exemplars. Figure 3 shows a sample meta-prompt for prompt optimization. 

serve as optimizers, which consistently improve the performance of the generated prompts through iterative optimization until convergence (see Figure 1). In particular, while these LLMs generally produce instructions of different styles (see Table 1), with zero-shot prompting, their best generated instructions match the few-shot chain-of-thought prompting performance when applied to PaLM 2-L, outperforming the zero-shot performance with human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K. Additionally, we observe that the OPRO-optimized prompts transfer to other benchmarks of the same domain and also deliver notable performance gain. 

# 2 OPRO: LLM AS THE OPTIMIZER 

Figure 2 illustrates the overall framework of OPRO. In each optimization step, the LLM generates candidate solutions to the optimization task based on the optimization problem description and previously evaluated solutions in the meta-prompt. Then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the meta-prompt for the subsequent optimization process. The optimization process terminates when the LLM is unable to propose new solutions with better optimization scores, or a maximum number of optimization steps has reached. We first outline the desired features of LLMs for optimization, then describe the key design choices based on these desirables. 

## 2.1 DESIRABLES OF OPTIMIZATION BY LLMS 

**Making use of natural language descriptions.** The main advantage of LLMs for optimization is their ability of understanding natural language, which allows people to describe their optimization tasks without formal specifications. For instance, in prompt optimization where the goal is to find a prompt that optimizes the task accuracy, the task can be described with a high-level text summary along with input-output examples. 

**Trading off exploration and exploitation.** The exploration-exploitation trade-off is a fundamental challenge in optimization, and it is important for LLMs serving as optimizers to balance these two competing goals. This means that the LLM should be able to exploit promising areas of the search space where good solutions are already found, while also exploring new regions of the search space so as to not miss potentially better solutions. 

## 2.2 META-PROMPT DESIGN 

As the input to the optimizer LLM, the meta-prompt contains the following two essential parts. 

**Optimization problem description.** The first part is the text description of the optimization problem, including the objective function and solution constraints. For example, for prompt optimization, the LLM can be instructed to “generate a new instruction that achieves a higher accuracy”, and we denote such instructions in the meta-prompt as _meta-instructions_ . We can also provide customized 

3 

Large Language Models as Optimizers 

meta-instructions as an informal regularization of the generated solutions, such as “the instruction should be concise and generally applicable”. 

**Optimization trajectory.** Besides understanding natural language instructions, LLMs are also shown to be able to recognize patterns from in-context demonstrations (Wei et al., 2023; Madaan & Yazdanbakhsh, 2022; Mirchandani et al., 2023). Our meta-prompt makes use of this property and instructs the LLM to leverage the optimization trajectory for generating new solutions. Specifically, the optimization trajectory includes past solutions and their optimization scores, sorted in the ascending order. Including optimization trajectory in the meta-prompt allows the LLM to identify similarities of solutions with high scores, encouraging the LLM to build upon existing good solutions to construct potentially better ones without the need of explicitly defining how the solution should be updated. 

## 2.3 SOLUTION GENERATION 

At the solution generation step, the LLM generates new solutions with the meta-prompt as input. The following are the key optimization challenges we address in this stage. 

**Optimization stability.** In the optimization process, not all solutions achieve high scores and monotonically improve over prior ones. Due to the sensitivity of in-context learning to the prompt, LLM output can be drastically affected by low-quality solutions in the input optimization trajectory, especially at the beginning when the solution space has not been adequately explored. This sometimes results in optimization instability and large variance. To improve stability, we prompt the LLM to generate multiple solutions at each optimization step, allowing the LLM to simultaneously explore multiple possibilities and quickly discover promising directions to move forward. 

**Exploration-exploitation trade-off.** We tune the LLM sampling temperature to balance between exploration and exploitation. A lower temperature encourages the LLM to exploit the solution space around the previously found solutions and make small adaptations, while a high temperature allows the LLM to more aggressively explore solutions that can be notably different. 

# 3 MOTIVATING EXAMPLE: MATHEMATICAL OPTIMIZATION 

We first demonstrate the potential of LLMs in serving as optimizers for mathematical optimization. In particular, we present a case study on linear regression as an example of continuous optimization, and on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as an example of discrete optimization. On both tasks, we see LLMs properly capture the optimization directions on small-scale problems merely based on the past optimization trajectory provided in the meta-prompt. 

## 3.1 LINEAR REGRESSION 

In linear regression problems, the goal is to find the linear coefficients that probabilistically best explain the response from the input variables. We study the setting in which the independent and dependent variables _X_ and _y_ are both one-dimensional and an intercept _b_ is present, so that there are two one-dimensional variables _w_ , _b_ to optimize over. In a synthetic setting, we sample ground truth values for one-dimensional variables _w_ true and _b_ true, and generate 50 data points by _y_ = _w_ true _x_ + _b_ true + _ϵ_ , in which _x_ ranges from 1 to 50 and _ϵ_ is the standard Gaussian noise. Our optimization starts from 5 randomly sampled ( _w, b_ ) pairs. In each step, we prompt an instructiontuned LLM with a meta-prompt that includes the best 20 ( _w, b_ ) pairs in history and their sorted objective values. The meta-prompt then asks for a new ( _w, b_ ) pair that further decreases the objective value. A sample meta-prompt is shown in Figure 19 of Appendix C.1. We prompt the meta-prompt 8 times to generate at most 8 new ( _w, b_ ) pairs in each step to improve optimization stability. Then we evaluate the objective value of the proposed pair and add it to history. We do black-box optimization: the analytic form does not appear in the meta-prompt text. This is because the LLM can often calculate the solution directly from the analytic form. 

Table 2 summarizes the results with one of the following optimizer LLMs: text-bison, gpt-3.5-turbo, and gpt-4. We study three settings of _w_ true and _b_ true: within the starting region [10 _,_ 20] _×_ [10 _,_ 20], “near outside” (each of _w_ true and _b_ true is outside the starting region but the distance is less than 10), and “far outside” (each of _w_ true and _b_ true is outside the starting region and the distance is greater than 10). We see:

Both _w_ and _b_ start from 5 random starting points in [10 _,_ 20]. We use temperature 1.0 for all models. We run each setting 5 times. The starting points are the same across optimizer LLMs but are different across 5 runs, and are grouped by: within the starting region, outside and close to the starting region, and outside and farther from the starting region. Bold numbers indicate the best among three LLMs in each setting.

- The number of unique ( _w, b_ ) pairs explored by each model is fewer than exhaustive search, indicating these models are able to to do black-box optimization: compare the numbers and propose a descent direction. 

- The text-bison and gpt-4 models outperform gpt-3.5-turbo in convergence speed: they arrive at the optima with fewer steps. The gpt-4 model also outperforms in finding the optima with fewer explored unique points. Taking a closer look at the optimization trajectory, we see gpt-4 is the best at proposing a reasonable next step from the history: for example, when the history shows the objective values of ( _w, b_ ) = (8 _,_ 7), ( _w, b_ ) = (8 _,_ 6), and ( _w, b_ ) = (8 _,_ 5) are decreasing, it has a highest chance to propose ( _w, b_ ) = (8 _,_ 4) for evaluation. 

- The problem becomes harder for all models when the ground truth moves farther from the starting region: all models need more explorations and more steps. 

## 3.2 TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM (TSP) 

Next, we consider the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) (Jünger et al., 1995; Gutin & Punnen, 2006), a classical combinatorial optimization problem with numerous algorithms proposed in literature, including heuristic algorithms and solvers (Rosenkrantz et al., 1977; Golden et al., 1980; Optimization et al., 2020; Applegate et al., 2006; Helsgaun, 2017), and approaches based on training deep neural networks (Kool et al., 2019; Deudon et al., 2018; Chen & Tian, 2019; Nazari et al., 2018). Specifically, given a set of _n_ nodes with their coordinates, the TSP task is to find the shortest route that traverses all nodes from the starting node and finally returns to the starting node. 

Our optimization process with LLMs starts from 5 randomly generated solutions, and each optimization step produces at most 8 new solutions. We present the meta-prompt in Figure 20 of Appendix C.1. We generate the problem instances by sampling _n_ nodes with both _x_ and _y_ coordinates in [ _−_ 100 _,_ 100]. We use the Gurobi solver (Optimization et al., 2020) to construct the oracle solutions and compute the optimality gap for all approaches, where the optimality gap is defined as the difference between the distance in the solution constructed by the evaluated approach and the distance achieved by the oracle solution, divided by the distance of the oracle solution. Besides evaluating OPRO with different LLMs including text-bison, gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4, we also compare OPRO to the following heuristics: 

- Nearest Neighbor (NN). Starting from an initial node, the solution is constructed with the nearest neighbor heuristic: At each step, among the remaining nodes that are not included in the current partial solution, NN selects the node with the shortest distance to the end node of the partial solution, and adds it as the new end node. The process finishes when all nodes have been added to the solution. 

- Farthest Insertion (FI). One caveat of the nearest neighbor heuristic is that it does not take the distance between the start and end node into consideration when constructing partial solutions. To address this issue, FI aims to optimize the cost of inserting new nodes into the partial solution at each step. Define the minimal insertion cost of adding a new node _k_ as

When no optimal solution is found for any evaluated problem, the corresponding number of steps is N/A.

_c_ ( _k_ ) = min( _i,j_ ) _d_ ( _i, k_ ) + _d_ ( _k, j_ ) _− d_ ( _i, j_ ), where _i_ and _j_ are adjacent nodes in the current tour, and _d_ ( _·, ·_ ) represents the distance between two nodes. At each step, FI adds a new node that maximizes the minimal insertion cost. 

We present the results in Table 3. We randomly generate 5 problem instances for each number of nodes _n_ . In addition to measuring the optimality gap, on problems where the LLM finds the optimal solutions, we also show the number of optimization steps taken to reach the global optimum. First, we observe that gpt-4 significantly outperforms gpt-3.5-turbo and text-bison across all problem sizes. Specifically, on smaller-scale problems, gpt-4 reaches the global optimum about 4 _×_ faster than other LLMs. On larger-scale problems, especially with _n_ = 50, gpt-4 still finds solutions with a comparable quality to heuristic algorithms, while both text-bison and gpt-3.5-turbo get stuck at local optima with up to 20 _×_ worse optimality gaps. 

On the other hand, the performance of OPRO degrades dramatically on problems with larger sizes. When _n_ = 10, all LLMs find the optimal solutions for every evaluated problem; as the problem size gets larger, the OPRO optimality gaps increase quickly, and the farthest insertion heuristic starts to outperform all LLMs in the optimality gap. 

**Limitations.** We would like to note that OPRO is designed for neither outperforming the stateof-the-art gradient-based optimization algorithms for continuous mathematical optimization, nor surpassing the performance of specialized solvers for classical combinatorial optimization problems such as TSP. Instead, the goal is to demonstrate that LLMs are able to optimize different kinds of objective functions simply through prompting, and reach the global optimum for some smallscale problems. Our evaluation reveals several limitations of OPRO for mathematical optimization. Specifically, the length limit of the LLM context window makes it hard to fit large-scale optimization problem descriptions in the prompt, e.g., linear regression with high-dimensional data, and traveling salesman problems with a large set of nodes to visit. In addition, the optimization landscape of some objective functions are too bumpy for the LLM to propose a correct descending direction, causing the optimization to get stuck halfway. We further elaborate our observed failure cases in Appendix A. 

# 4 APPLICATION: PROMPT OPTIMIZATION 

Next, we demonstrate the effectiveness of OPRO on prompt optimization, where the objective is to find the prompt that maximizes task accuracy. We first introduce the problem setup, then illustrate the meta-prompt design. 

## 4.1 PROBLEM SETUP 

We focus on prompt optimization for natural language tasks, where both the input and output are in the text format. The task is represented as a dataset with training and test splits, where the training set is used to calculate the training accuracy as the objective value during the optimization process, and we compute the test accuracy on the test set after the optimization finishes. While traditional optimization often requires a decently large training set, our experiment shows that a small number or fraction of training samples (e.g., 3.5% of the training set for GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), 20% for Big-Bench Hard (Suzgun et al., 2022)) is sufficient. The objective function evaluator is an LLM

I have some texts along with their corresponding scores. The texts are arranged in ascending order based on their scores, where higher scores indicate better quality. text: Let’s figure it out! score: 61 text: Let’s solve the problem. score: 63 (. . . more instructions and scores ...) 

The following exemplars show how to apply your text: you replace <INS> in each input with your text, then read the input and give an output. We say your output is wrong if your output is different from the given output, and we say your output is correct if they are the same. input: Q: Alannah, Beatrix, and Queen are preparing for the new school year and have been given books by their parents. Alannah has 20 more books than Beatrix. Queen has 1/5 times more books than Alannah. If Beatrix has 30 books, how many books do the three have together? A: <INS> output: 140 (. . . more exemplars ...) Write your new text that is different from the old ones and has a score as high as possible. Write the text in square brackets. 

Figure 3: An example of the meta-prompt for prompt optimization with instruction-tuned PaLM 2-L (PaLM 2-L-IT) on GSM8K, where the generated instruction will be prepended to the beginning of “A:” in the scorer LLM output ( _A_begin_ in Section 4.1). <INS> denotes the position where the generated instruction will be added. The blue text contains solution-score pairs; the purple text describes the optimization task and output format; the orange text are meta-instructions. 

to which the optimized prompt will be applied, and it can be the same or different from the LLM for optimization. We denote the LLM for objective function evaluation as the _scorer LLM_ , and the LLM for optimization as the _optimizer LLM_ . 

The output of the optimizer LLM is an _instruction_ , which is concatenated to the question part of every exemplar and prompts the scorer LLM. We consider the following positions to insert the instruction: 

- _Q_begin_ : the instruction is added before the original question. 

- _Q_end_ : the instruction is added after the original question. 

- _A_begin_ : the instruction is added to the beginning of the scorer LLM output. This is applicable to pretrained LLMs without instruction tuning, where the prompt is formatted as a sequence of QA pairs. 

We exemplify these prompting formats in Appendix B. 

- 4.2 META-PROMPT DESIGN 

Figure 3 shows an example of the meta-prompt for prompt optimization on GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). More details are as follows.

**Optimization problem examples.** The problem description includes a few examples taken from the training set to demonstrate the task for the generated instructions. For example, from the input-output pair in Figure 3, we can infer this is a math word problem. The input-output pair also demonstrates the position where the generated instruction will be added to, and this is essential for the optimizer LLM to generate instructions of the same style. In each optimization step, we add several (three for example) training examples to the meta-prompt by random sampling the training set or choose the ones the previous instructions fall short of. 

**Optimization trajectory.** The optimization trajectory includes instructions generated from the past optimization steps, along with their scores. The old instructions and scores are sorted by the score in ascending order. The score is the training accuracy in prompt optimization. We only keep instructions with the highest scores in the meta-prompt in consideration of the LLM context length limit. 

**Meta-instructions.** We also add _meta-instructions_ : the instructions to the optimizer LLM that explain the optimization goal and instruct the model how to use the above information. The meta-instructions may also specify the desired generated instruction format for easier parsing. 

# 5 PROMPT OPTIMIZATION EXPERIMENTS 

We present the evaluation results for prompt optimization in this section. Our experiments demonstrate that OPRO brings a significant performance gain across the board, with different combinations of LLMs as the optimizer and the scorer. 

Section 5.1 describes the experiment setup. Section 5.2 shows main results on reasoning tasks like GSM8K and BBH. Section 5.3 shows ablation studies. Section 5.4 analyzes overfitting in prompt optimization. Section 5.5 compares the prompt optimization performance of meta-prompts in OPRO and EvoPrompt (Guo et al., 2023). 

## 5.1 EVALUATION SETUP 

**Models.** The LLMs we use as the optimizer and the scorer are: 

- Optimizer LLM: Pre-trained PaLM 2-L (Anil et al., 2023), instruction-tuned PaLM 2-L (denoted PaLM 2-L-IT), text-bison, gpt-3.5-turbo, and gpt-4. 

- Scorer LLM: Pre-trained PaLM 2-L and text-bison. 

With pre-trained PaLM 2-L as the scorer, the optimizer LLM generates A_begin instructions. Since text-bison has been instruction-tuned, the optimizer LLM generates Q_begin and Q_end instructions when text-bison is used as the scorer. 

**Benchmarks.** Our primary evaluation benchmarks are GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and Big-Bench Hard (BBH) (Suzgun et al., 2022). GSM8K is a benchmark of grade school math word problems with 7,473 training samples and 1,319 test samples, where chain-of-thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022) and the zero-shot instruction “Let’s think step by step.” (Kojima et al., 2022) have drastically improved the performance over the standard prompting. BBH is a suite of 23 challenging BIG-Bench tasks (Srivastava et al., 2022) that covers a wide range of topics beyond arithmetic reasoning, including symbolic manipulation and commonsense reasoning. Each task contains up to 250 examples in total. 

To examine the transferability of the optimized instructions, we also evaluate the instructions optimized for GSM8K on two other mathematical reasoning datasets, i.e., MultiArith (Roy & Roth, 2016) and AQuA (Ling et al., 2017). 

**Implementation details.** We set the temperature to be 0 when evaluating the performance of generated instructions, in which case the scorer LLM greedily decodes. Unless otherwise specified, we set the default temperature to be 1.0 for optimizer LLMs to generate diverse and creative instructions. At each optimization step, we prompt the optimizer LLM with the meta-prompt 8 times to generate 8 instructions, then we add these instructions with their training scores to the optimization trajectory in the meta-prompt. Our meta-prompt at each step contains the best 20 instructions so far and 3 randomly picked exemplars from the training set. We study the effect of different hyperparameters in ablation studies (Section 5.3). Appendix C.2 presents the full meta-prompts for different optimizer LLMs.

## 5.2 MAIN RESULTS 

We show prompt optimization curves on GSM8K and two BBH tasks in this section. The curves on other BBH tasks are deferred to Appendix D, and the tables containing all accuracy numbers are in Appendix E. 

## 5.2.1 GSM8K 

For prompt optimization, we randomly sample 3.5% examples from the GSM8K training set. The same subset is used throughout optimization, so that the task accuracies computed at intermediate optimization steps are approximations of the training accuracy on all 7,473 training examples. This balances the evaluation cost with the generalization performance. After the optimization procedure finishes, we evaluate the found instructions on the entire GSM8K test set. 

Figure 1(a) in Section 1 shows prompt optimization curves with pre-trained PaLM 2-L as scorer and PaLM 2-L-IT as optimizer, and the initial instruction is “Let’s solve the problem” with a (approximated, and same below) training accuracy of 60.5. We observe that the optimization curve shows an overall upward trend with several leaps throughout the optimization process, for example: 

9 

Large Language Models as Optimizers 

- “Let’s think carefully about the problem and solve it together.” at Step 2 with the training accuracy 63.2; 

- “Let’s break it down!” at Step 4 with training accuracy 71.3; 

- “Let’s calculate our way to the solution!” at Step 5 with training accuracy 73.9; 

- “Let’s do the math!” at Step 6 with training accuracy 78.2. 

The optimization curves also generally show a decrease of the variance among the accuracies of instructions generated at each step, indicating that the optimizer LLM generates _distributionally_ better instructions throughout the optimization. 

Next, we present the results of generating Q_begin instructions with the text-bison scorer and the PaLM 2-L-IT optimizer, starting from an empty instruction with a 57.1 training accuracy. The optimization curve in Figure 4(a) shows a similar upward trend, during which a few leaps in the training accuracy include: 

- “Solve the following problems using the given information.” at Step 2 with training accuracy 59.8; 

- “Solve the following problems by applying the given information and using the appropriate mathematical operations.” at Step 3 with training accuracy 64.0; 

- “Let’s read the problem carefully and identify the given information. Then, we can create an equation and solve for the unknown variable.” at Step 4 with training accuracy 67.0; 

- “I’m always down for solving a math word problem together. Just give me a moment to read and understand the problem. Then, I’ll create an equation that models the problem, which I’ll solve for the unknown variable. I also may or may not use some helpful diagrams or visuals to understand the problem. Lastly, be sure to allow me some time to carefully check my work before submitting any responses!” at Step 29 with training accuracy 70.1. 

Note that although our default setting is to run OPRO for 200 steps in prompt optimization, we need much fewer steps if the goal is to find some outstanding instructions. An example is that the Figure 1(a) experiment found “Let’s do the math!” at Step 6 with training accuracy 78.2, almost matching the “Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.” found at the 107th step with training accuracy 80.2, at a point where the optimization curve is still trending upwards. This is because a leap in our optimization curve does not always correspond to a much better instruction being discovered; instead, it can be due to a large qualitative improvement of all 8 generated instructions in this step. The latter usually happens several steps after the former: after a much better instruction is discovered in one step, the meta-prompt gradually gets rid of worse instructions in the latter steps by generating instructions similar to the much-better one. The top instructions kept in the meta-prompt gradually improves in this procedure. At a point when the meta-prompt only triggers higher quality instructions, the leap happens. 

Finally, Figure 4(b) shows that the pre-trained PaLM 2-L can also serve as the optimizer LLM and improve its own prediction performance. Different from other optimizer LLMs that are instructiontuned, the pre-trained PaLM 2-L performs better when the prompt is formatted in a few-shot manner. Therefore, we include two initial instructions to start the optimization: the empty instruction (with a training accuracy 32.2) and “The answer is” (with a training accuracy 33.3). See Figure 21 in Appendix C for the meta-prompt format. The generated instructions follow the same style as “The answer is”: most instructions are also phrases suitable as the prefix of a sentence, like “Here you go:” (generated at Step 11 with training accuracy 61.3) and “Let’s do it:” (generated at Step 13 with training accuracy 75.1). 

Table 4 summarizes top instructions found on GSM8K with different scorer and optimizer LLMs. We observe that: 

- The styles of instructions found by different optimizer LLMs vary a lot: PaLM 2-L-IT and text-bison ones are concise, while GPT ones are long and detailed. 

- Although some top instructions contain the “step-by-step” phrase, most others achieve a comparable or better accuracy with different semantic meanings.

Figure 4: Prompt optimization on GSM8K with (a) the text-bison scorer and the PaLM 2-L-IT optimizer, and (b) pre-trained PaLM 2-L as both scorer and optimizer. 

## 5.2.2 BBH 

On BBH, the optimization starts from an empty string as the initial instruction by default. The instructions are placed at A_begin when the scorer is PaLM 2-L, and at Q_begin when the scorer is text-bison. For each task, we utilize a subset of 20% examples for prompt optimization, and the rest examples are for testing. We show experimental results on more variants of the instruction position and initialization in Appendix E. 

Figure 5 visualizes the per-task accuracy difference on all 23 BBH tasks compared to the instruction “Let’s think step by step.” (Kojima et al., 2022) and the empty instruction, and we present the concrete accuracies in Table 7 of Appendix E. We show that the instructions found by OPRO outperform “Let’s think step by step.” on almost all tasks by a large margin: our instructions outperform by over 5% on 19/23 tasks with the PaLM 2-L scorer, and on 15/23 tasks with the text-bison scorer. Our prompt optimization algorithm also improves instructions from the empty starting point by over 5% on most tasks: 20/23 with the PaLM 2-L scorer and 15/23 with the text-bison scorer. 

Similar to GSM8K, we observe upward trends in optimization curves on almost all BBH tasks, as shown in Figure 6. See Figure 23 and 24 in Appendix D for more curves on other BBH tasks. 

We next show some examples of instructions found through the course of optimization. On the task ruin_names, starting from the empty instruction (with 64.0 training accuracy), with the text-bison scorer and the PaLM 2-L-IT optimizer, the following instructions are generated: 

- “Consider the following when editing artist or movie names humorously:” at Step 1 with training accuracy 72.0; 

- “When making humorous edits of artist or movie names, you can change one or more letters or even create puns by adding new words that sound similar.” at Step 18 with training accuracy 80.0; 

- “We can make humorous edits of artist/movie names by changing letters to create new words that are similar in sound but have different meanings. For example, The Police can be changed to The Polite, The Abyss can be changed to Toe Abyss, and Schindler’s List can be changed to Schindler’s Lost.” at Step 38 with training accuracy 82.0. 

Although the above instructions are semantically similar, a paraphrase by the optimizer LLM offers a notable accuracy improvement. We further highlight this observation in Section 5.2.3. 

Below are some instructions generated when performing prompt optimization on temporal_sequences, starting from the empty instruction (with the training accuracy of 64.0): 

- “To solve this problem, we need to first identify the time period when the person was not seen doing anything else. Then, we need to check if the place they went to was open during that time period. If it was, then that is the time period when they could have gone to that place.” at Step 2 with training accuracy 42.0; 

- “To find the time period when a person could have gone to a place, identify the time periods when they were not seen doing anything else and the place was open. If there are multiple time periods that match these criteria, then the person could have gone to the place during any of these time periods.” at Step 18 with training accuracy 54.0;

different optimizer LLMs produce instructions of different styles. See Appendix E for results on more BBH tasks. 

## 5.2.3 SEMANTICALLY SIMILAR INSTRUCTIONS MAY ACHIEVE DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT ACCURACIES 

One challenge of prompt optimization is the sensitivity of model performance to subtle changes in the instruction. For example, with the PaLM 2-L scorer on the GSM8K test set, “Let’s think step by step.” achieves accuracy 71.8, “Let’s solve the problem together.” has accuracy 60.5, while the accuracy of “Let’s work together to solve this problem step by step.” is only 49.4, although it is the semantic combination of the two upper instructions. This behavior increases both the variance across single-step instructions and the oscillation during optimization, and motivates us to generate multiple instructions at each step to improve the optimization stability. 

## 5.2.4 TRANSFERABILITY OF FOUND INSTRUCTIONS 

We assess the transferability of found prompts to different datasets of the same domain, where we evaluate the top instructions found for GSM8K on two more math reasoning benchmarks MultiArith (Roy & Roth, 2016) and AQuA (Ling et al., 2017). Table 6 shows that our optimized prompts also outperform baseline prompts with different scorer LLMs on these two benchmarks. 

## 5.3 ABLATION STUDIES 

We use text-bison as the scorer and PaLM 2-L as the optimizer for all ablation studies. The tasks we evaluate are GSM8K (math reasoning) and BBH sports_understanding (non-math reasoning). 

**Meta-prompt design.** The meta-prompt design is crucial in achieving good prompt optimization performance. We investigate the following core design choices: 

- _The order of the previous instructions._ We compare the following options: (1) from lowest to highest (our default setting); (2) from highest to lowest; (3) random. Figures 7(a) and 7(b) show that the default setting achieves better final accuracies and converges faster. One hypothesis is that the optimizer LLM output is affected more by the past instructions closer to the end of the meta-prompt. This is consistent with the recency bias observed in Zhao et al. (2021), which states that LLMs are more likely to generate tokens similar to the end of the prompt. 

- _The effect of instruction scores._ In terms of how to present the accuracy scores, we compare three options: (1) rounding the accuracies to integers, which is equivalent to bucketizing the accuracy scores to 100 buckets (our default setting); (2) bucketizing the accuracies to 20 buckets; (3) not showing the accuracies, only showing the instructions in the ascending order. Figures 7(c) and 7(d) show that the accuracy scores assists the optimizer LLM in better understanding the quality difference among previous instructions, and thus the optimizer LLM proposes better new instructions that are similar to the best ones in the input optimization trajectory. 

- _The effect of exemplars._ We compare three options: (1) showing 3 exemplars from the task (default); (2) showing 10 exemplars from the task; (3) no exemplars. Figures 7(e) and 7(f) show

that presenting exemplars in the meta-prompt is critical, as it provides information on what the task looks like and helps the optimizer model phrase new instructions better. However, more exemplars do not necessarily improve the performance, as a few exemplars are usually sufficient to describe the task. In addition, including more exemplars results in a longer meta-prompt with a dominating exemplar part, which may distract the optimizer LLM from other important components like the optimization trajectory. 

**The number of generated instructions per step.** Computing a mini-batch of gradients reduces the variance of a stochastic gradient descent procedure. Similarly, generating multiple instructions in each step improves the optimization stability with LLMs. On the other hand, to achieve better performance with a fixed budget for the number of instructions to evaluate, the number of per-step instructions should not be too large, so as to allow more optimization steps to incorporate richer information of past instructions with their accuracies. Taking both aspects into consideration, Figure 8 compares the optimization performance of sampling 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 (default) / 16 instructions in each step, showing that sampling 8 instructions at each step overall achieves the best performance. 

**Starting point.** We study the effect of different initial instructions for prompt optimization. Our default setting is to start from an empty string when the scorer LLM is (instruction-tuned) text-bison, and to start from either the empty string (on BBH tasks) or “Let’s solve the problem.” (on GSM8K) with instruction position A_begin when the scorer LLM is the (pre-trained) PaLM 2-L. Figure 9(a) shows the performance of text-bison as the scorer LLM with 3 options of initial instructions: (1) the empty string; (2) “Solve the following problem.”; or (3) “Solve the following problem.” and “Let’s solve the problem.”. We observe that the accuracies do not differ much with different starting points. Interestingly, the styles of the generated instructions are also similar. For example, most of the generated instructions starting from (1) and (2) contain the phrase “solve this problem”, like “Let’s work together to solve this problem.” in Step 4 with training accuracy 64.8 from (1), and “Let’s solve the following problems using the given information.” in Step 3 with training accuracy 62.8 from (2).

Figure 9: **Ablation studies: the initial instructions for prompt optimization.** The dots are the average values across 3 optimization repetitions, and the shaded regions represent standard deviations. 

Figure 9(b) presents the results of of PaLM 2-L as the scorer LLM with the following options of initial instructions: (1) “Let’s solve the problem.”; (2) the empty string; or (3) “Let’s think step by step.”. We notice that the performance differs much more with different initial instructions, especially at the beginning of the optimization. Specifically, starting from (1) leads to better generated instructions than (2) in the first 30 steps, while the instructions optimized from both (1) and (2) are worse than (3) throughout. A similar observation holds when using PaLM 2-L as scorer and gpt-3.5-turbo as optimizer for BBH tasks, by comparing the results starting from the empty string (Appendix E.2) and from “Let’s solve the problem.” (Appendix E.3). Taking a closer look into the optimization process of (2), we find that although both “solve the problem” and “step by step” show up in generated instructions at Step 5, it takes the optimizer LLM more steps to get rid of worse instructions presented in the meta-prompt when starting from instructions with lower accuracies. Therefore, one direction for future work is to accelerate convergence from weaker starting points.

Figure 10: **Ablation studies: temperature of the optimizer model.** The dots are the average values across 3 optimization repetitions, and the shaded regions represent standard deviations. 

**Diversity per step.** We evaluate the following temperatures of the optimizer LLM: {0.0, 0.5, 1.0 (default), 1.5, 2.0}. Figure 10 shows the default temperature 1.0 achieves the best performance. Specifically, optimizations with smaller temperatures (0.0 and 0.5) lack exploration and thus creativity, and the optimizer LLM often gets stuck at the same instruction for tens of steps, resulting in flat optimization curves. On the other hand, with larger temperatures (1.5 and 2.0), the optimizer LLM more often ignores the trajectory of previous instructions presented in the meta-prompt and thus lacks exploitation, therefore the optimization curve does not have a steady upward trend. 

**Comparison with one-step instruction generation.** Our current iterative procedure runs for multiple steps and generates a new batch of solutions in each step. To validate the importance of leveraging the optimization trajectory for generating new prompts, we compare to a baseline that generates all instructions in a single step without entering into the optimization procedure. We compare these two approaches on GSM8K and BBH sports_understanding with the PaLM 2-L-IT optimizer. For GSM8K the scorer LLM is pre-trained PaLM 2-L and the initial instruction is “Let’s solve the problem”, and for BBH sports_understanding the scorer LLM is text-bison and the initial instruction is the empty string. The baseline generates 50 instructions in a single step, thus its meta-prompt only includes task exemplars, the initial instruction with its accuracy, and the same meta-instructions as our full meta-prompt for performing optimization. All the other hyperparameters remain the same. 

Our results show that this one-step instruction generation performs much worse than our optimization approach. Specifically: (1) On GSM8K, the best instruction among all 50 is still “Let’s solve the problem”, with a 64.4 training accuracy and a 60.8 test accuracy. On the other hand, our approach (corresponding to Figure 1(a) in the main paper) found “Let’s do the math!” with a 78.2 training accuracy and a 76.3 test accuracy at the 5th step by generating 8 instructions at each step. (2) Similarly, on BBH sports_understanding, the best instruction among all 50 achieved a 84.0 training accuracy and 80.0 test accuracy. This is again worse than the instruction found by our approach at Step 4, which achieved a 88.0 training accuracy and a 84.5 test accuracy. 

## 5.4 OVERFITTING ANALYSIS IN PROMPT OPTIMIZATION 

For simplicity, we do not set aside a validation set in our default setting of prompt optimization. We made this decision based on the experiments when a validation set is present. 

Overfitting may result in training accuracy being much higher than the validation/test accuracy. It is difficult to avoid overfitting, but overfitting is less harmful when each candidate solution (natural language instruction in the prompt optimization context) overfits to a similar extent. In this case, a higher training accuracy solution still achieves a higher validation/test accuracy, and one can adopt solutions with the highest training accuracies as the final result. Figure 11 shows this is the case for OPRO in prompt optimization: when setting aside a validation set with the same size as the training

set, the validation accuracy curves trend up and down alongside the training curves in both prompt optimization settings. 

Of course, overfitting still occurs in the instructions found by our prompt optimization: in Table 7 and 10, our training accuracies are often 5%-20% higher than our test accuracies, despite that our test and overall accuracies are still mostly higher than human-written counterparts. Setting aside a larger training set and optimizing for fewer steps (early stopping) may help reduce overfitting. 

## 5.5 COMPARISON WITH EVOPROMPT 

Some concurrent works on prompt optimization propose meta-prompts that explicitly ask the LLM to perform mutation and crossovers of existing prompts (Fernando et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023). In our evaluation, we compare our approach to the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Differential Evolution (DE) versions of EvoPrompt (Guo et al., 2023). Specifically, in the GA meta-prompt, given two prompts, the meta-prompt instructs the LLM to cross over the two prompts and generates a new one, then mutates the newly generated prompt to produce the final prompt. DE extends the GA meta-prompt to include more detailed instructions, e.g., asking the LLM to identify different parts between the two given prompts before performing the mutation. This is in contrast with OPRO, which leverages the optimization trajectory including multiple past prompts, instead of only 2 previous prompts. Meanwhile, OPRO also provides the LLM with richer information to facilitate the understanding of the optimization problem, including exemplars and task accuracies of different prompts. 

Figure 12 presents the results on GSM8K and BBH sports_understanding benchmarks, where we use gpt-3.5-turbo as the optimizer. On GSM8K, the initial instructions of all approaches are “Let’s solve the problem.” and “Here is the answer.”, which are simple and generic. Again, we observe that OPRO performance steadily improves with more optimization steps. On the other hand, both versions of EvoPrompt even degrade the performance on GSM8K. The main reason is because EvoPrompt does not utilize exemplars for prompt optimization, thus it lacks the understanding of the task to optimize for. In this way, EvoPrompt relies on good-quality and task-specific initial prompts to optimize from. 

Given this observation, we provide more task-specific initial instructions for experiments on BBH sports_understanding, which are “Solve the sports understanding problem.” and “Give me the answer to sports understanding.” In this case, EvoPrompt (DE) is able to find better prompts than the initial ones, but the optimization curve is less stable than OPRO. This indicates that leveraging the optimization trajectory helps the LLM to identify promising directions to improve existing prompts.

Figure 12: **Comparison with EvoPrompt in prompt optimization.** We use the gpt-3.5-turbo optimizer for both experiments. “EvoPrompt (GA)” uses the meta-prompt from Guo et al. (2023), Figure 1; “EvoPrompt (DE)” uses the meta-prompt from Guo et al. (2023), Figure 2. All optimizations in (a) use the pre-trained PaLM 2-L scorer and start from two simple instructions “Let’s solve the problem.” and “Here is the answer.”; all optimizations in (b) use the text-bison scorer and start from two richer (task-specific) instructions “Solve the sports understanding problem.” and “Give me the answer to sports understanding.”. The dots are the average values across 3 optimization repetitions, and the shaded regions represent standard deviations. We use temperature 1.0 for OPRO and temperature 0.5 for EvoPrompt, same as the default settings in respective works. 

# 6 RELATED WORK 

**Prompt optimization.** Prior works have developed soft prompt-tuning methods that optimize the prompt represented as task-specific continuous vectors (Lester et al., 2021; Li & Liang, 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Qin & Eisner, 2021), as well as performing discrete prompt optimization by gradient-guided search (Shin et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2023d) and reinforcement learning (Deng et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). These approaches become inapplicable when there is only API access to the LLM. Other works designed edit-based approaches for gradient-free prompt optimization (Xu et al., 2022; Prasad et al., 2022), where the editing can be done with humandefined operations (e.g., swapping two phrases) (Prasad et al., 2022) or language models (e.g., back translation) (Xu et al., 2022). Some recent works investigate LLMs for prompt optimization (Zhou et al., 2022b; Pryzant et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023). Specifically, APE (Zhou et al., 2022b) first uses the LLM to generate initial instructions. Afterwards, APE selects top instructions with the highest accuracies, then prompts the LLM with each individual instruction to generate a semantically similar variant of the initial instruction. APO (Pryzant et al., 2023) in each step instructs the LLM to produce text feedback on how to update an old instruction. Different from edit-based approaches, the optimizer LLM in our work directly generates new instructions at each optimization step, and the optimizer LLM is merely asked to improve the task accuracy without being required to imitate past instructions. Compared to Zhou et al. (2022b) and Pryzant et al. (2023), our optimization process incorporates the past generated instructions with their scores in the meta-prompt, enabling the optimizer LLM to discover common patterns of high-quality instructions. 

**Prompting with natural language feedback.** A recent line of work investigates approaches to improve the LLM performance by prompting with natural language feedback to revise the model output, which has shown effectiveness in reducing harmful LLM outputs (Bai et al., 2022; Ganguli et al., 2023), improving reasoning (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023) and code generation performance (Chen et al., 2023e; Olausson et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b), dialogue applications (Nair et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023), and so on (Kim et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). Specifically, Yuan et al. (2023) develops a human-in-the-loop framework for deriving system-level feedback from a collection of instance-level feedback, which is then used 

20

for refining data. In our work, the optimizer LLM utilizes the optimization trajectory in the prompt, which implicitly requires the LLM to summarize the common characteristics among solutions with similar scores. We consider incorporating explicit natural language feedback on generated solutions for later optimization steps as future work. 

**Tuning language models for optimization.** Some previous works tune or prompt language models to behave as mutation and crossover operators in evolutionary algorithms. Meyerson et al. (2023) utilizes language models with few-shot exemplars to propose evolutionary cross-overs on tasks such as image and code generation. In Lehman et al. (2022), the large language model trained on code diff generation is used as the mutation operator, and they further design a fine-tuning method to improve performance in the Sodarace domain for robot simulation. EvoPrompting (Chen et al., 2023a) uses large language models to evolve neural network architectures, where they combine evolutionary search with soft prompt tuning. With respect to taking the trajectory as the input for optimization, OptFormer (Chen et al., 2022) trains a transformer model on large collections of hyperparameter optimization data. On the other hand, our work performs optimization solely by prompting without additional training. 

# 7 CONCLUSION 

We embark on employing LLMs as optimizers, where the LLM progressively generates new solutions to optimize an objective function. We first motivate OPRO with linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then proceed to prompt optimization as a concrete application. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLMs have the capacity of gradually improving the generated solutions based on the past optimization trajectory. Interestingly, on small-scale traveling salesman problems, OPRO performs on par with some hand-crafted heuristic algorithms. For prompt optimization, optimized prompts outperform human-designed prompts on GSM8K and Big-Bench Hard by a significant margin, sometimes over 50%. 

A number of unresolved questions are open for future research on LLMs for optimization. In general, how to reduce the sensitivity to initialization and better balance exploitation with exploration remains a challenge. Specifically, for prompt optimization, one limitation of our current implementation is that the optimizer LLM does not effectively utilize error cases in the training set to infer promising directions to improve the generated instructions. In our experiments, we tried including error cases in the meta-prompt rather than randomly sampling from the training set at each optimization step, but the results are similar, indicating that the error cases alone are not informative enough for the optimizer LLM to grasp the cause of the wrong prediction. Another limitation is that prompt optimization requires a training set to compute the accuracy that guides the optimization process. Currently the training set at least contains tens of samples, so that the optimized prompt does not severely overfit to the training samples. A promising direction is to incorporate richer feedback about the error cases besides the aggregated accuracy, and summarize the key features that distinguish between high-quality and low-quality generated prompts in the optimization trajectory. Such information may inform the optimizer LLM of how to more efficiently improve over the past generated instructions, and potentially further reduce the example set size needed for prompt optimization. 

# ETHICS STATEMENT 

This work uses synthetic math problems for linear regression and traveling salesman problems, and uses public datasets like GSM8K and Big-Bench Hard for prompt optimization. These tasks have been commonly used in similar works and should not be regarded controversial. There is a peril that LLMs may generate harmful information that poses safety risks; how to safeguard model behavior remains valuable future work. 

# REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT 

We evaluate on public benchmarks. The text-bison API is available at: https://cloud. google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/models. The GPT models are available here: http://openai.com/api/. This work uses gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613.

Large Language Models as Optimizers 

# A SOME FAILURE CASES 

Although LLMs show the power of optimizing basic math problems (Section 3) and prompts (Section 4), we see some limitations across all optimizer LLMs that may impede their power of solving more challenging problems. These limitations include: 

- **Hallucinating the values that need to come from math calculation** : The optimizer LLMs often output contents like “the function value at (5, 3) is 15” despite that the true value is not 15. The model will get it right if external tools that can reliably calculate the value are triggered. When and how to trigger such tool use cases remains an interesting topic (see e.g., (Schick et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023)). 

- **Generating solutions already appeared in context even if we tell it to "Give me a new (w, b) pair that is different from all pairs above"** : the optimizer LLMs do not 100% reliably follow this instruction even if its own outputs often include sentences like “I will provide a new pair that is different”, making the output self-contradictory. The output is almost guaranteed to be different from in-context old solutions when the model output contains a comparison of the new pair and all old pairs, though. Thus (implicitly) triggering such behaviors may be a solution. How to implement this feature without harming the instruction following performance of other parts remains an interesting topic to study. 

- **In black-box math optimization, getting stuck at a point that is neither global nor local optimal** : This often occurs in two linear regression cases: (a) The in-context exemplars all share the same _w_ or _b_ that is different from _w_ true or _b_ true. This case is more likely to be avoided when a larger number of past solutions are included in the meta-prompt; (b) one or several of the best previous solutions in the meta-prompt have _w_ s and _b_ s in quantitatively opposite directions from the global optima _w_ true and _b_ true: for example, the _w_ s are all smaller than _w_ true while the _b_ s are all larger than _b_ true. Since the optimizer model often proposes to only increase _w_ or decrease _b_ when the past solutions in meta-prompt share _w_ or _b_ , the optimization will get stuck if either increasing _w_ or decreasing _b_ would increase the objective value. This issue is mitigated by sampling multiple new solutions (thus more exploration) at each step. 

- **Hard to navigate a bumpy loss landscape** : Like other optimizers, it is harder for the optimizer LLM to optimize black-box functions when the loss landscape gets more complicated. For example, when minimizing the Rosenbrock function _f_ ( _x, y_ ) = ( _a−x_ )<sup>2</sup> + _b_ ( _y−x_<sup>2</sup> )<sup>2</sup> with _a_ = 20 (whose global optimal point is _x_ = 20, _y_ = 400) with 5 starting points in [10 _,_ 20] _×_ [10 _,_ 20], the optimization often gets stuck at around (0 _,_ 0). This is because the optimizer LLM sees a decrease of objective value when it drastically decreases both _x_ and _y_ to 0. Then starting from (0 _,_ 0), the optimizer LLM is hard to further navigate _x_ and _y_ along the narrow valley in the loss landscape towards (20 _,_ 400) (Figure 13).

The global optima is at _x_ = 20, _y_ = 400 with function value 0. The function value at _x_ = 0, _y_ = 0 is 400. The landscape has a narrow valley between (0 _,_ 0) and (20 _,_ 400).

C.2 META-PROMPT FOR PROMPT OPTIMIZATION 

Different optimizer models work the best on different styles of meta-prompts. Figure 3 in the main paper shows the meta-prompt for PaLM 2-L-IT; Figure 21 shows that for pre-trained PaLM 2-L; Figure 22 shows that for GPT models. 

Create a piece of text at the beginning of the answer to enhance the precision in solving diverse grade school math problems.

Your task is to generate the instruction <INS>. Below are some previous instructions with their scores. The score ranges from 0 to 100. 

text: Let’s figure it out! score: 61 text: Let’s solve the problem. score: 63 (. . . more instructions and scores ...) Below are some problems. Problem: Q: Alannah, Beatrix, and Queen are preparing for the new school year and have been given books by their parents. Alannah has 20 more books than Beatrix. Queen has 1/5 times more books than Alannah. If Beatrix has 30 books, how many books do the three have together? A: <INS> Ground truth answer: 140 (. . . more exemplars ...) 

Generate an instruction that is different from all the instructions <INS> above, and has a higher score than all the instructions <INS> above. The instruction should begin with <INS> and end with </INS>. The instruction should be concise, effective, and generally applicable to all problems above.

Table 7: Accuracies on BBH tasks: our found instructions with the PaLM 2-L-IT optimizer vs baseline. The optimization starts from the empty string. Because of the 20-80 train-test split, we show accuracies with the format “training / test / overall (training + test)”. The PaLM 2-L scores are from A_begin instructions; the text-bison scores are from Q_begin instructions. Bold numbers indicate the best for the corresponding task.

|Task<br>|Our Instruction<br>|
|---|---|
|boolean_expressions|A Boolean expression is a well-formed expression consisting of variables, values, and logical operators. The expression<br>must evaluate to a single True or False value. The order of precedence of the logical operators is as follows: NOT, AND,<br>OR, XOR, IMP. Parentheses can be used to group subexpressions and to control the order of evaluation.|
|causal_judgement|When considering questions about causation, a typical person would consider the following factors: whether the action<br>or event was a necessary condition for the outcome to occur, a sufficient condition, a proximate cause, or a foreseeable<br>cause.|
|date_understanding|To find the date X time ago from today, first find today’s date. Then subtract X time from today’s date. If the current<br>date is the last day of a month, then the date a month ago is the last day of the previous month. If the current date is not<br>the last day of a month, then the date a month ago is the same day of the previous month. For example, if today is<br>March 31, 2023, then the date a month ago is February 28, 2023. If today is April 1, 2023, then the date a month ago is<br>March 1, 2023.|

|dyck_languages|First, look for the opening parentheses. Then, count the number of opening parentheses. Finally, close the parentheses<br>in the reverse order that they were opened.|
|formal_fallacies|A deductive argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. If the premises are true, then<br>the conclusion must also be true. An invalid argument is one where it is possible for the premises to be true and the<br>conclusion to be false.|
|geometric_shapes|A closed polygonal chain is a series of connected line segments. The line segments can be straight or curved. The first<br>and last line segments are connected. The line segments do not intersect each other except at their endpoints. A closed<br>polygon can be described by an SVG path element, which starts at a given point, goes to one or more additional points,<br>and then ends at the starting point. The path element can consist of straight line segments, curved segments, or a<br>mixture of both.|
|hyperbaton|The correct adjective order in English is opinion, size, shape, age, color, origin, material, and purpose. If you have more<br>than one adjective of the same type, they are usually placed in order of importance. For example, you would say "a<br>large, old, Pakistani ship" rather than "an old, large, Pakistani ship." There are a few exceptions to these rules, but they<br>are generally followed in most cases.|
|logical_deduction<br>_seven_objects|The following questions will test your ability to use deductive reasoning. You will be given a set of statements about a<br>group of objects. You will then be asked to answer questions about the objects based on the statements. The statements<br>in the questions are logically consistent, so you can use them to deduce the order of the objects. For each question, you<br>must choose the option that is logically consistent with the information in the questions.|
|movie_recommendation|Based on your input, I have analyzed the given movies in terms of genre, plot, tone, audience rating, year of release,<br>director, cast, and reviews. I have also taken into account the given options. The movie that is most similar to the given<br>movies in terms of all these factors is:|
|multistep_arithmetic<br>_two|The order of operations in mathematics is PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division,<br>Addition, and Subtraction. When there are multiple operations of the same precedence, they must be performed from<br>left to right. Note that multiplication and division have the same precedence, as do addition and subtraction.|

|ruin_names|Which is the funniest pun on the artist or movie name?|
|salient_translation<br>_error_detection|Instructions: Read the German sentence and its English translation carefully, then identify the type of error in the<br>translation and select the correct option. There are six possible types of errors: Named Entities, Numerical Values,<br>Modifiers or Adjectives, Negation or Antonyms, Facts, and Dropped Content.|
|snarks|Identify the sarcastic statement by considering the following factors: incongruity, exaggeration, understatement, context,<br>speaker’s intent, and audience’s reaction. I will also consider the speaker’s tone of voice, facial expressions, and body<br>language.|
|sports_understanding|I will determine if a sentence about an athlete is plausible by first checking if it is grammatically correct. If it is, I will<br>then check if it is consistent with the athlete’s sport, position, and real-world statistics. I will also check if it is consistent<br>with the rules of the athlete’s sport. If the sentence is consistent with all of these things, I will answer "yes", otherwise I<br>will answer "no".|

|tracking_shuffled_objects<br>_seven_objects|Claire has the blue ball, Gertrude has the black ball, and Dave has the green ball. They are all happy with their new<br>balls.|
|web_of_lies<br>word_sorting|The answer to a question is yes if there are an odd number of liars before the current speaker, and no if there are an even<br>number of liars before the current speaker. If the current speaker is a truth-teller, they will say the opposite of what the<br>previous person said, while a liar will say the same thing as the previous person said.<br>Alphabetical order of given words:|

|date_understanding|Today is February 28, 2023. It is a Tuesday. Yesterday was Monday, February 27, 2023. Tomorrow will be Wednesday,<br>March 1, 2023. A week ago, it was February 21, 2023, and a month ago, it was January 28, 2023. A year from now, it<br>will be February 28, 2024. The day of the week is important to note because it will help us to correctly answer the<br>questions below. Not all years are leap years that contain February 29.|
|disambiguation_qa|A pronoun is a word that stands in for a noun. The noun that a pronoun refers to is called its antecedent. To identify the<br>antecedent of a pronoun, look for the noun that the pronoun could be referring to. If there is only one possible noun,<br>then that is the antecedent. If there are two or more possible nouns, then the antecedent is ambiguous. Use the context<br>of the sentence to help you determine the correct antecedent.|

|geometric_shapes|What shape is this SVG code drawing, and how many sides does it have?|
|hyperbaton|In English, adjectives are typically placed before nouns in a specific order. The order is: opinion, size, shape, age, color,<br>origin, material, purpose, noun. For example, the sentence "the big, old, red barn" would be considered grammatically<br>correct, while the sentence "the old, big, red barn" would not. Adjectives that come before nouns are called attributive<br>adjectives, while adjectives that come after nouns are called predicative adjectives.|
|logical_deduction<br>_seven_objects|In this logical reasoning task, you will be given a series of paragraphs, each of which describes a set of objects arranged<br>in a fixed order. The statements in each paragraph are logically consistent. You must read each paragraph carefully and<br>use the information given to determine the logical relationships between the objects. You will then be asked a question<br>about the order of the objects. Read each question carefully and choose the option that answers the question correctly.|
|movie_recommendation|What is the highest-rated movie similar to the given movies, with a similar IMDb rating and released in the same year?|
|multistep_arithmetic_two|Let’s solve these equations using PEMDAS order of operations. Remember that PEMDAS stands for parentheses,<br>exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction.|
|navigate|Starting at the origin, facing north, follow the instructions. If your displacement from the origin is zero and your<br>direction is unchanged, then your answer is Yes. Otherwise, your answer is No.|
|object_counting|Let me help you count the items you have. Just list them one by one, separated by commas. I will then count each item<br>and tell you how many items there are in total.|
|penguins_in_a_table|This table shows information about penguins. The columns show the penguin’s name, age, height (in cm), and weight<br>(in kg). The penguins are listed in order of their age, from youngest to oldest.|
|reasoning_about<br>_colored_objects|First, read the input carefully. Then, identify all the objects mentioned, their colors, and their positions. Next, visualize<br>the objects and their positions in your mind. Finally, answer the questions accurately based on the information given.<br>Make sure to pay attention to the order of the objects.|
|ruin_names|A humorous edit of an artist or movie name can be created by replacing one or more letters to form a new word or<br>phrase that sounds similar but has a different meaning. The new word or phrase should be relevant to the original word,<br>but it should also be a surprise, which makes the edit funny. For example, the artist or movie name "Rocky" can be<br>changed to "Ricky," and "Schindler’s List" can be changed to "Schindler’s Lift." Be creative and have fun!|
|salient_translation<br>_error_detection|The following translations from German to English contain a particular error. The error may be one of the following<br>types: Named Entities, Numerical Values, Modifiers or Adjectives, Negation or Antonyms, Facts, or Dropped Content.<br>Please identify the error.|
|snarks|The statement|
|sports_understanding|To determine the plausibility of a sports sentence, I will first identify the sport, athletes, teams, and events mentioned in<br>the sentence. Then, I will use my knowledge of the rules of the sport, the context of the sentence, common sense, and<br>my knowledge of the world to determine whether the sentence is plausible. I will also consider the time period and<br>location, as well as any other relevant information. Finally, I will return a score of 1 for plausible sentences and 0 for<br>implausible ones.|
|temporal_sequences|To determine the time period when a person went to a place, first identify all the time periods when the person’s<br>whereabouts are unknown. Then, rule out any time periods during which the person was seen doing something else or<br>the place was closed. The remaining time periods are the possible times when the person could have gone to the place.|
|tracking_shuffled_objects<br>_seven_objects|At the start of the game, Claire has a blue ball. Throughout the game, pairs of people swap balls. Claire ends up with<br>the yellow ball.|
|web_of_lies<br>word_sorting|People in a group either tell the truth or lie. The truthfulness of a person’s statement is determined by the statement of<br>the previous person. If the previous person told the truth, then the current person who says the opposite is lying. If the<br>previous person lied, then the current person who says the opposite is telling the truth. This rule applies to all<br>subsequent statements.<br>Sort the following words alphabetically, ignoring case and punctuation. Print the sorted list.|

Large Language Models as Optimizers 

E.2 GPT-3.5-TURBO AS OPTIMIZER, OPTIMIZATION STARTING FROM THE EMPTY STRING 

Table 11, 12 and 13 show the instructions found by prompt optimization. Their accuracies are listed in Table 10. Figure 25 visualizes the difference between their accuracies and those of the baselines “Let’s think step by step.” and the empty string. The optimizations find instructions better than the empty starting point, and most of the found instructions are better than “Let’s think step by step”. 

One caveat in the A_begin instructions (Table 11) is that a lot of the found instructions are imperative or interrogative sentences that are more suitable to be put into “Q:” rather than “A:”, like “Solve the sequence by properly closing the parentheses.” for dyck_languages and “Which movie option from the given choices ...?” for movie_recommendation. Such styles appear more often here than the PaLM 2-L-IT optimizer results (Table 8), showing PaLM 2-L-IT understands the needed style better. In Section E.3, we show the A_begin optimization results with the non-empty starting point “Let’s solve the problem.”. Most results there are declarative sentences – more suitable for A_begin.

- E.3 PALM 2-L AS SCORER, GPT-3.5-T U R B O AS OPTIMIZER, OPTIMIZATION STARTING FROM “LET’S SOLVE THE PROBLEM.” 

Figure 26 and Table 14 compare the accuracies of found instructions vs “Let’s solve the problem.”, “Let’s think step by step.”, and the instructions in Table 11. Table 15 details the found instructions. 

The “Let’s” pattern appears more often in the found instructions because of the starting points, and the instructions are more often declarative that are more suitable for A_begin, even if some are semantically far from “Let’s solve the problem”. In fact, “Let’s” was adopted by Zhou et al. (2022b) as a fixed pattern in generated prompts, possibly because of the same reason.
