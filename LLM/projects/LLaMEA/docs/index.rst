**LLaMEA** (Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm) is an innovative framework
that leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 for the
automated generation and refinement of metaheuristic optimization algorithms.
The framework utilizes a novel approach to evolve and optimize algorithms
iteratively based on performance metrics and runtime evaluations without
requiring extensive prior algorithmic knowledge. This makes LLaMEA an ideal tool
for both research and practical applications in fields where optimization is
crucial.
