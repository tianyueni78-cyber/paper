LLaMEA
======

The :class:`~llamea.llamea.LLaMEA` class implements the evolutionary loop
around a large language model. Its behaviour is governed by many
hyper-parameters controlling population sizes, mutation style, diversity and
evaluation.

Recent features include:

* **Niching** – enable ``niching="sharing"`` or ``niching="clearing"`` to
  maintain diversity. ``distance_metric``, ``niche_radius``,
  ``adaptive_niche_radius`` and ``clearing_interval`` further tune the niches.
* **Diff mode** – set ``diff_mode=True`` to request SEARCH/REPLACE patches
  instead of entire source files from the LLM. This is more token efficient for large code bases.
* **Population evaluation** – with ``evaluate_population=True`` the evaluation
  function ``f`` operates on lists of solutions, allowing batch evaluations.
* **Multi-objective mode** – set ``multi_objective=True`` and provide
  ``multi_objective_keys=[...]`` to optimize multiple objectives and maintain a
  Pareto archive instead of a single best solution.
* **Warm start** -With every iteration, **LLaMEA** archives its latest run in
    `<experiment_log_directory>/llamea_config.pkl`. The framework provides
    **``warm_start`` class methods** that allow you to resume from a previously
    saved state. This methods:
        - Accept the path to the ``<experiment_log_directory>``.
        - Restore the most recent object from the archive.
        - Reinitialize the program in warm-start mode.
    After restoring the object, you can call `restored_object.run()` to continue execution
    from the point where the program was last terminated, while updating the same experiment
    directory.
*  **Initial Population**  -After a cold start, initialisation of LLaMEA object
   one can use `.run(<experiment_log_directory>)` to start with latest individual
   from the run logged in that directory. Make sure to use similar initialisation
   criteria, as was used in the logged experiment.
