# This is a minimal example of how to use the LLaMEA algorithm with the Gemini LLM to generate optimization algorithms for the BBOB test suite.
# We have to define the following components for LLaMEA to work:
# - An evaluation function that executes the generated code and evaluates its performance.
# - A task prompt that describes the problem to be solved.
# - An LLM instance that will generate the code based on the task prompt.

    The optimization algorithm should handle a wide range of tasks, which is evaluated on the BBOB test suite of 24 noiseless functions. Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.
    The func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between -5.0 (lower bound) and 5.0 (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.
    Give an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and also give it a one-line description with the main idea.
