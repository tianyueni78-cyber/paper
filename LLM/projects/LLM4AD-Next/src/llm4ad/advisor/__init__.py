"""Evolve-block advisor for LLM4AD.

On-demand analysis for a user-selected code block against a stated
algorithm-evolution goal. Returns structured feedback — feasibility,
significance, concerns, suggestions, rationale — that a frontend can
render next to the user's selection before committing to an expensive
evolution run.

Direct API::

    from llm4ad.advisor import advise_block_sync

    advice = advise_block_sync(
        goal="minimize comparisons on random inputs",
        repo_path="./my_solver/",
        file_path="src/algo.py",
        line_range=(42, 87),
        api_key="sk-...",
        model="gpt-4o",
    )
    print(advice.to_dict())

Config-based API (recommended for multi-user platforms)::

    from llm4ad.advisor import generate_advisor_config, advise_from_config_sync

    generate_advisor_config("advise_config.yaml", goal="...")
    # user fills in credentials, then:
    advice = advise_from_config_sync("advise_config.yaml")

The advisor is fully independent from :mod:`llm4ad.builder` — it reads
only public utilities from :mod:`llm4ad.infra.repo_analyzer` and
:mod:`llm4ad.infra.provider`.
