"""Data classes produced by the evolve-block recommender.

The recommender scans a repository against a user goal and proposes
single-block evolution targets grouped into three tiers:

- ``core``        — the most promising minimal block
- ``expanded``    — widenings of the core block (optional)
- ``alternatives``— other standalone blocks elsewhere (optional)

LLM4AD's evolution engine is single-block-only today, so picking any
recommendation replaces the others; tiers are *choices*, not a set to
co-evolve. See [src/llm4ad/planner/sampler/init_sampler.py:102] and
siblings for the single-block constraint.

    Attributes:

        core: The core recommendation. ``None`` only if the discovery
            call itself succeeded but the LLM refused to produce one;
            in that case the recommender raises instead of returning,
