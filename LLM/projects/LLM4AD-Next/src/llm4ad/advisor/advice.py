    Attributes:
        block_summary: One to three sentences describing what the block
            currently does. Grounded in the block content, not the goal.
        feasibility: One of ``"yes"``, ``"partial"``, ``"no"``. Whether
            evolving this block can plausibly move the goal metric.
        feasibility_reason: Short justification for the feasibility verdict.
        significance: One of ``"high"``, ``"medium"``, ``"low"``. How
            impactful successfully evolving this block would be relative
            to the stated goal.
        significance_reason: Short justification for the significance
            verdict.
        concerns: Bullet list of risks or pitfalls the user should know
            before launching evolution on this block.
        suggestions: Bullet list of concrete, actionable refinements
            (e.g., extend the block to include a helper, narrow it to
            only the scoring function, add a metric).
        rationale: One-paragraph overall assessment tying feasibility,
            significance, concerns, and suggestions together.
        score: Optional numeric score reserved for ranking when multiple
            candidate blocks are compared. Populated by the recommender
            layer, not by single-block advice.
        block_ref: Optional reference to the block that was analyzed
            (file path, line range, block name). Useful for frontends
            that display results next to the source selection.
        lang: Language used for the LLM's free-text fields. ``"en"`` (the
            default) means English; ``"zh"`` means Simplified Chinese.
            Set by the advisor at request time so frontends can render
            the result without re-detecting.
